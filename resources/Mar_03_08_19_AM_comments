{"BojanglesFinest": "I have come to the conclusion I am doing all I can to not catch this. I am keeping social distance even at work. I am cleaning my hands and being conscience of touching myself. However if I get it I get it. And if I die I die. I\u2019m about 95% confident I won\u2019t get it and 99% confident I won\u2019t die. But at this point I just care they my wife and daughter don\u2019t get it or get it bad. I have life insurance. They can make it without me. I can\u2019t make it without either of them. Unfortunately what it takes to get through this is a community caring. But at this point I\u2019m just going to be like the rest of Americans and say fuck everyone but mine and not care about them. They don\u2019t care enough to help contain this.", "flutterbyasaurus": "Thank you. I can't tell you how much I needed this. I've been in panic mode because my 10yo has really bad asthma and I can't stop thinking \"what if he gets it and there's no room at the hospital for him\"."}
