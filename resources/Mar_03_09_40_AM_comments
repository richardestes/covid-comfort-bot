I can't imagine what it's like for people who get no played sick time at all.", "kodamahan1": "Ah shit. I've been trying to find hard data on this. I quit smoking 5 years ago but still vaping. It's been on my mind recently. Time to switch to gum!

It was good work until 10 days ago.  People began hoarding.  Everyday you wake up to some Yahoo ordering 100 cases of costco water.  4300 pounds of water.  We have passenger cars.  The companies pay very little, and even with people not wanting to goto stores themselves, they are tipping nothing.  I saw a 100 case order that paid $23.  That is why this is not a feasible option.  10x the demands to put workers at risk for a couple dollars.  I have stopped working until this is over.  I have seen the worst of humanity over the past week and I refuse to be part of it.  Get your orders now, these services are not going to be running much longer as this progresses."}
