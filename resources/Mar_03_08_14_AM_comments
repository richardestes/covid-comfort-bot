{"MostlyQueso": "I\u2019m here. I\u2019m worried too. I took my kid out of school already. We are going to do two weeks of school at home and reassess. I\u2019m worried that by the time the schools figure out that they should have done something, it\u2019ll be too late. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry. Anybody who is \u201cclose\u201d to you and telling you to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d isn\u2019t a friend. Friends show compassion.\n\nI hear you. I think your concerns are valid. You\u2019re not alone."}
